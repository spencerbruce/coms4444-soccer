                              useful if there are a large number of losses
                              Sacrifice points from wins (with randomness)
                              Sacrifice draws only if we have more realloctable pts than the opponent 
                              Give points to losses + draws with some randomness
                              Return unallocated points
                              
               - strategy 2 composite = similar to strategy 2, but with extra requirements
                              only subtract from a win where we are doing worse then the opponent in the prev rankings
                              give up on draws only if we have less available goals than the opponent 
                              give as many points to losses
                              return unallocated points

               - strategy 5 = worry about how the apponent is doing wrt their available goals to reallocate
                              check before taking away from wins
                              adjust conservativeness/riskiness cutoff depending on how well they are doing compared to us
                              reallocate goals to draws and losses, following a sort by reallocatable pts
