     /* strategy methods

                                   draws from highest points --> lowest points 
                                   losses from lowest margin --> highest margin 
                              Prioritize winning draws with random variation of points 
                              taken from wins and given to draws
               - strategy 2 = same sort as strategy 1, useful if there is a large number of losses 
                              Prioritize trying to win losses, which means sacrificing both wins and draws 
                              Sacrifice draws only if we have more reallocatable goals than the opponent 
                              Still randomizing taking goals from wins
                              give to losses

               - strategy 2.5 = strategy 2 but without the contingency of # of reallocatable goals ???
               - strategy 2.5 = strategy 2 but with the contingency of # of games opponent has won ???
               - strategy 2.5 = strategy 2 but with the contingency of rank ???
               - strategy X = Maxing out draw each round, or max out success each round 

               sort draws in another direction? 
     
          TODO: see how much of a threat all other teams are
               This is better than calculating it on an opponent-by-opponent basis for our round-prioritization perspective 
          TODO: instead of randomly selecting a strategy, prioritize rank, prev # of wins, or something else
               sub-TODO: implement multiple strategies, calcualte how successful they were and apply weights with time
               sub-TODO: Maybe count how many games are in won/lost/drawn to determine which points to reallocate?
                    $ how much they have to reallocate
                    X how many games they won/loss/drawn (average? or current tally?)
                         ^^^ this is basically rank lol
                    $ the average performance of the previous strategies
                    Scott has been working on this! If strategy 1 has been working more than strategy 2, choose strategy 1
                    Exponentially weighted moving average -- gives more weight to the recent trials than ancient ones
                         does the excess data make this stronger or weaker? 

       
          TODO: calculate likeliness of opponent to remove points from draw, hope that they will remove and you won't need to
               ^^ let's use the available points for now maybe?
          TOOD?: EWMA for how people reallocate goals/if it's the same across the board or not? 
               Doesn't solve the problem with the hashmap tho 
          
          TODO: implement strategies game-by-game, not round-by-round
               Does not bode well for us taking a round approach to maximizing wins or draws, for example 
               BUT can use for mini-decisions (like whether or not to give points to a drawn game)
          TOOD: take goals from winning games when the margin is small?
               tends to make results worse, maybe not ^
          TODO: check to see if opponent is in the top ranks
               not necessary, we are taking the approach round-by-round not game-by-game
          TODO: switch strategies X% into the total number of rounds?
